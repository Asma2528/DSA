        ** How the approach works **
        1. Recursive exploration from current index
        Start at idx = 0 with jumps = 0.
        At each index, look at nums[idx] — this tells you how far you can jump from here (1 to nums[idx] steps).
        2. Try all possible next jumps
        For every step from 1 to nums[idx], recursively call the function on idx + step and jumps + 1.
        This explores all possible paths you can take through the array.
        3. Base condition
        If idx >= last index, it means we reached (or crossed) the end — return the number of jumps taken so far.
        4. Find the minimum
        From all recursive paths, take the minimum jump count and return it
